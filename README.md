# BERT-Enhanced YouTube Content Recommendation System

This repository contains the code and resources for building a YouTube video recommendation system using BERT embeddings. The project leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to generate meaningful embeddings for video titles and descriptions, which are then used to recommend relevant videos to users.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system that suggests YouTube videos based on their semantic similarity, captured by BERT embeddings. This approach aims to provide more accurate and contextually relevant recommendations compared to traditional methods.


## Key Features

*   **BERT Embeddings:** Utilizes BERT to create rich semantic embeddings of video titles and descriptions.
*   **Similarity-Based Recommendations:** Recommends videos based on the similarity of their BERT embeddings.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle large datasets of YouTube videos.


## Requirements

*   Python 3.7+
*   PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the BERT implementation)
*   Transformers library (Hugging Face)
